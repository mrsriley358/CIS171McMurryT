# Grading Notes

Looks like things got a little complicated? The insertion sort is the only one being executed. Code for other sorts appears to be in place?
Make sure to compare apples to apples - generate the list to be sorted only once, then copy it for each sort so that each sort is using
the same list.

Incomplete implementation.

Put each sort into it's own class. That will simplify each class and allow for better re-use.
