## write a program that sorts using radix sort, selection sort, buble sort, merge sort, quick sort and heap sort for input size 60, 100, 150, 250, and 300 thousand



### I will create a generater for the array, then create each sort type. Once each sort works correctly I will time each and have it print out the time it took in milliseconds to complete the task.



### Testing

The program will be tested one sort at a time making sure each one works correctly before the next sort is ran.
