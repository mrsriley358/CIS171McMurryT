## write a program that lets two user talk. Give a user two areas, one for put the text in and the other just for display so make sure its not editable, then when putting
text in pressing enter will submit it. then have the other user be able to do the same.



### I will build a user one(Server) get it to be able to submit text then use that build to user 2(client) and have them be able to respong and message.



### Testing

I will start with creating the GUI interface where the two users can have a talk where, where each one has two text field a view (one that can't be edited) and another field where the user
writes their text and submits it to the uneditable field.
